# Agile Project Management Methodology Using Kanban

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

Kanban is based on a philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are "pulled" from a product backlog into a steady workflow. The framework is applied using kanban boards--a form of visual project management.

Kanban boards consist of cards that represent tasks, and columns that represent stages of work. The cards move from left to right as they progress through the workflow. The columns can be customized to suit the needs of each team, but a common example is: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`.

## Benefits

The main benefits of using kanban boards are:

- They help visualize the work and identify bottlenecks or blockers.
- They limit the work-in-progress to avoid overloading the system and ensure quality.
- They enable faster feedback and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
- They foster a culture of continuous improvement and adaptation.

## Core principles

To use kanban effectively, teams should follow four core principles:

- **Visualize the workflow**: Make the work visible and clear for everyone involved.
- **Limit the work-in-progress**: Set a maximum number of cards allowed in each column to prevent multitasking and reduce waste.
- **Manage the flow**: Monitor the speed and smoothness of the work moving through the board, and optimize it as needed.
- **Improve collaboratively**: Review the performance and outcomes regularly, and implement changes based on data and feedback.
