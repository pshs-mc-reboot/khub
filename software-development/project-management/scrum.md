# Agile project management methodology using Scrum

Agile project management is an iterative and incremental approach to delivering software products that focuses on continuous releases and customer feedback. Scrum is one of the most popular agile frameworks that uses fixed-length iterations of work, called *sprints*, to guide teams in the planning, execution, and review of their work. Scrum also defines a set of roles, artifacts, and ceremonies that help teams structure and manage their work effectively.

## Roles

The main roles in Scrum are:

- The **product owner**, who represents the voice of the customer and is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, which is a list of features and requirements for the product.
- The **Scrum master**, who facilitates the Scrum process and helps the team follow the Scrum values, principles, and practices. The Scrum master also removes any impediments that might hinder the team's progress.
- The **development team**, who are self-organizing and cross-functional professionals who work together to deliver potentially shippable increments of the product at the end of each sprint.

## Artifacts

The main artifacts in Scrum are:

- The **product backlog**, which is a dynamic and ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. The product owner is accountable for managing and refining the product backlog.
- The **sprint backlog**, which is a subset of the product backlog that the development team commits to complete in a sprint. The sprint backlog also includes a plan for how the work will be done.
- The **increment**, which is the sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint and all previous sprints. The increment must be usable and meet the definition of done, which is a shared understanding of what it means for a product backlog item to be complete.

## Ceremonies

The main ceremonies in Scrum are:

- The **sprint planning**, which is a time-boxed event where the product owner and the development team agree on what product backlog items will be delivered in the sprint and how they will be done.
- The **daily Scrum**, which is a 15-minute event where the development team inspects their progress and plans their work for the next 24 hours. The daily Scrum also helps identify any issues or risks that need to be addressed.
- The **sprint review**, which is a time-boxed event where the development team demonstrates the increment to the product owner and other stakeholders and collects feedback on what to do next.
- The **sprint retrospective**, which is a time-boxed event where the development team reflects on their performance and identifies ways to improve their processes, practices, and interactions.

Scrum is based on empirical process control, which means that it relies on observation and experimentation rather than detailed upfront planning. Scrum also promotes transparency, inspection, and adaptation as key principles to ensure that the team delivers value to the customer and responds to changing needs.

## Core principles

Some of the core principles of Scrum are:

- **Value-driven delivery**, which means that the team focuses on delivering the highest value features to the customer as early and frequently as possible, and prioritizes the product backlog accordingly.
- **Self-organization**, which means that the team has the autonomy and authority to decide how to best accomplish their work, without being micromanaged by external forces.
- **Collaboration**, which means that the team works together as a cohesive unit, and communicates effectively with the product owner and other stakeholders to ensure alignment and feedback.
- **Time-boxing**, which means that the team works in fixed-length iterations called sprints, and limits the amount of work in progress to avoid overcommitment and waste.
- **Continuous improvement**, which means that the team inspects and adapts their product, process, and practices on a regular basis, and embraces change as an opportunity to learn and grow.
