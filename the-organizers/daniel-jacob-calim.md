# Daniel Jacob Calim (Jacob)

Hello po! I'm Jacob and I'm a Grade 11 from Block G. I'm currently taking Physics as my core subject and CS as my elective.

## Jacob's experience with competitive programming

I just got into competitive programming when I joined RAM because of an invite from Computron but I got hooked with the problem solving experience so here I am now. I also joined NOI and CCC last year but I didn't do that great. I learned a lot this summer from codeforces and other websites so I'm probably a bit better with Comp Prog now. I often use python for solving problems but sometimes I use C++.

## Jacob's experience with software development

Our project for CS4 was a clicker game based off cookie clicker (made with Java). I wrote most of our model code and some of the GUI part so I think I am somewhat ok with it. I also learned the very basics of Unity and C# this summer and made a simple game with it. I also made a quiz website with HTML, CSS and JS as my CS project back in Grade 9.
