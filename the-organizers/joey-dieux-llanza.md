# Dieux Llanza (Joey)

Hello, just call me Joey. G12 from Zara. Took CS 5 last year and now taking tech. Core is Bio ðŸ˜…

## Joey's experience with competitive programming

I only really first got into it last sy thanks to RAM, tried a bunch of the stuff we were given, joined Abakoda, CCC Juniors, and NOI altho didn't really do much there due to hell week ðŸ’€. Had quite a lot of fun and even tried doing some more of the stuff during the summer but that's it from me.

## Joey's experience with software development

All I have is the short time that RAM softdev was a thing and that was it. Ig in G10 I solo'd my project in a single qtr cuz was p bored and then just spent the rest adding random stuff. And to an extent ig there's also my research project altho my other groupmate was the one who's mainly developed it since I instead was the one swamped with the paperwork ðŸ˜…. Hoping to get a working version soon and get some testers maybe you guys would be interested when that comes woo
