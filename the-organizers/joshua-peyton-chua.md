# Joshua Peyton Chua (Joshua)

Hello everyone! I'm Joshua from block 11-B. I am currently taking chemistry as my core and biology as my elective. I like to play video games (mainly valorant --> peak diamond currently plat ðŸ«¥) and a variety of sports (basketball, swimming, badminton, ping pong, chess(?)). I also play the piano and occasionally make 2d and 3d design projects.

## Joshua's experience with competitive programming

Honestly, I don't really have much experience with competitive programming. I would say that my closest experience to this was trying some simple problems shown to me by my cousin, who loves joining coding competitions. I also able to learn about python and scratch from before I entered Pisay from a book my parents got me, in addition to the Pisay computer science curriculum that taught us other coding languages.

## Joshua's experience with software development

During elementary school, I used to make and play games on a coding website called Tynker, although it dealt more with block coding than the usual text coding used in more advanced languages. In Grade 9, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the curriculum, and honestly, those were the computer science topics I enjoyed the most among all grade levels. Lastly, in Grade 10, I was part of the ITI elective where one of our topics was using Unity to develop our own games.
