# The organizers

Just in case you missed the first meetings that we've had, here's a lengthy introduction to each of the Reboot organizers!

## Dieux Llanza (Joey)

Hello, just call me Joey. G12 from Zara. Took CS 5 last year and now taking tech. Core is Bio üòÖ

### Joey's experience with competitive programming

I only really first got into it last sy thanks to RAM, tried a bunch of the stuff we were given, joined Abakoda, CCC Juniors, and NOI altho didn't really do much there due to hell week üíÄ. Had quite a lot of fun and even tried doing some more of the stuff during the summer but that's it from me.

### Joey's experience with software development

All I have is the short time that RAM softdev was a thing and that was it. Ig in G10 I solo'd my project in a single qtr cuz was p bored and then just spent the rest adding random stuff. And to an extent ig there's also my research project altho my other groupmate was the one who's mainly developed it since I instead was the one swamped with the paperwork üòÖ. Hoping to get a working version soon and get some testers maybe you guys would be interested when that comes woo

## Diogn Lei Mortera (Diogn)

Hallo everyone! My name is Diogn Lei Mortera (pronounced with a silent 'g'); you can call me "Diogn" or "Kuya Diogn", whichever you prefer. My previous sections were Garnet-Rosal-Rubidium-Gluon, and I'm currently a student belonging at Block G. My academic interests mainly revolve around Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science; on the other hand, my non-academic interests mostly involve PC and board gaming, chess, Rubik's cubing, movies, and music!

My DMs are open almost anytime, so feel free to talk to me about my academic/non-academic interests, or anything in particular :D

### Diogn's experience with competitive programming

To provide a background of my knowledge, I have experience in the programming languages taught in the PSHS curriculum (C++, JavaScript, Java, Python). My interests in gaming also helped me learn game-oriented programming languages (Lua, C#).
As mentioned above, I also have experience with various Codeforce (and some Leetcode) challenges, as well as national and international competitions such as NOI.ph and CCC.

### Diogn's experience with software development

Web-development-wise, I have intermediate knowledge of front-end tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Application-wise, I have knowledge of vanilla Java, as well as both JavaFX and Swing (although, I am more familiar with the former).

## Maya Bartolabac (Maya)

Hi guys! I'm Maya, and I go by she/her and other feminine stuff. I really am sorry if I look and sound like a boy in real life. I am a 2025 from Lantican, taking Physics Core and CS Elective.

### Maya's experience with computer science in general

For CompProg, my only experience was with joining RAM in 2022 when I enjoyed going through the CodeForces starter problems. For SoftDev, my only experience with that was carrying my classmates in CS projects. That and a failed attempt to make a game.

Honestly, I've always really lacked the confidence and motivation of doing something big. If you want some good looking achievements, you have to start at some time, and I'm starting now. I guess I am a late bloomer compared to the rest of the organizers here. But I will make up for that by blooming big.

## Ieuan Vinluan (Ieuan)

Hello!! I'm Ieuan, and I'm in G11 !! I'm fine with any pronouns :D

### Ieuan's experience with competitive programming

I joined a coding camp a few months ago and got really into compprog because of it!! This summer, I started solving more problems online, studying more of the concepts involved in many compprog problems, and recently started joining online compprog contests. I think I have a decent grasp of the basics of these concepts, but I'm not that great in contest settings üò≠ üò≠

### Ieuan's experience with software development

My very very first experience with software development was making games in Scratch at a programming camp a few years ago. A few years later, I got into software development more (because of school). I started out making random games with HTML / CSS / JS in G9, and in G10, I made a knock off version of KHub with JavaFX for CS4, which was kinda fun. I also tried making machine learning models, although they're not that complex in nature LOL

## Krixian Skye Del Rosario (Skye)

Hello y'all!! I'm Skye, currently a grade 11 student (G-Ro-Li-Gl-G) taking Phy3 and CS5 :DD (my pronouns are he/him!)

As for my interests, I'm a very avid gamer, both when it comes to tabletop games and video games (recently, i've been playing a lot of genshin üëâüëà)! Also, I like to read webtoons and other webcomics!!

### Skye's experience with competitive programming

Not gonna lie, I actually haven't had much experience with CompProg until I joined RAM last SY (I discovered it very very indirectly through a friend, actually). I initially just joined the SoftDev division since I didn't think I'd be a very fast coder, but then a few of my friends went CompProg and I decided to try things there too, and they ended up being super fun! Competitions-wise, I've competed in both NOI.ph 2023 and CCC 2023 (ngl, nothing beats the euphoria of correctly solving the problems, even if they're "easy" ones), and I still plan to (hopefully) compete in future CompProg events as well!

Also, C++ mains wya !!!

### Skye's experience with software development

As for SoftDev, I've worked on a few websites before, both in elem and in Pisay. For my Grade 9 WebDev project, I decided to do a MrBeast-themed website (yes, I made a fanpage :'''' AHAHAH), which basically just talked about the history of MrBeast and his rise to YouTube fame! That site is probably so outdated by now so uhhh yea !!!

You might have already assumed by this point, but I have experience in using the usual WebDev trio languages (HTML-CSS-JS). I can usually hold my own in terms of doing WebDev with these three, but due to lack of practice, I've gotten a bit rusty :') (Google's always there for the save whenever I need it tho üôè)

## Clark Tongco (Clark)

Hello there! My name is Clark Tongco, and I'm from Block B. You can call me Clark (or Kuya Clark for lower batches). My interests are centered on chemistry, biology, and computer science (sometimes physics). In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and kdramas. I also enjoy solving Rubik's cubes and playing chess.

### Clark's experience with computer science in general

I began coding when I was in eighth grade. C++ was my first programming language, and it is still my favorite. I like how simple it is to understand, and I see its potential in building various projects and solving problems. Some of the games I've made with C++ include Battleship, Tic Tac Toe, and many others. Unfortunately, I don't have a duplicate of them because that was quite some time ago. HTML and JavaScript were presented to us in Grade 9. I also enjoy JavaScript because it is one of those programming languages that is simple to learn and understand. I used these to make various webpages and had a great time doing so. Finally, in Grade 10, we learned about Java. This programming language is one of my least favorites since it gave me a hard time especially in creating projects.

## Sam Gianan (Sam)

Hi! I'm Sam (she/her) of B2025! I'm into writing, 3D modelling, drawing, coding, and researching!

### Sam's experience with competitive programming

I've done very little competitive programming; usually I've just read through problems on Codeforces with friends T-T However, I decided recently to put time into learning more CompProg and try out more problems. I've also had a good time doing the sample logic problems back when I still had CS as a subject. Soonetheless, despite this lack of experience, I've been coding since 2020 and I think I can say I have good design thinking and problem solving skills (albeit applied in other aspects i.e. Math, Engineering, and Research)!

### Sam's experience with software development

I'm much more confident here! I started out coding with C++ in Grade 8 (though tried out Python and Scratch even years ago), and made my final project as a text-based burger restaurant simulator!

In Grade 9, I revisited Python and Scratch even more and learned HTML, CSS, and JS as well. Our final project this time was a puzzle-based website game. If it's not obvious now, I'm into web development and game development a lot!

I spent the time after making projects such as an introductory website for our friend group, an 8-bit-themed game about Hercules, and even ideating a web app!

In Grade 10, I learned Java, with our final project being an investigative horror-comedy game with battles, puzzles, and storylines! Not only did I do some coding for this, but I also made all of the art assets! It was also around this time that I played with the Chrome Music Maker to make 8-bit-themed music.

I also started learning Flutter and Renpy. I've also been working on learning Unity for more game development projects, especially since I want to apply my aforementioned asset skills along with knowledge in writing and 3D modelling! Currently, my friend and I are ideating some app/website projects. :)))

## Daniel Jacob Calim (Jacob)

Hello po! I'm Jacob and I'm a Grade 11 from Block G. I'm currently taking Physics as my core subject and CS as my elective.

### Jacob's experience with competitive programming

I just got into competitive programming when I joined RAM because of an invite from Computron but I got hooked with the problem solving experience so here I am now. I also joined NOI and CCC last year but I didn't do that great. I learned a lot this summer from codeforces and other websites so I'm probably a bit better with Comp Prog now. I often use python for solving problems but sometimes I use C++.

### Jacob's experience with software development

Our project for CS4 was a clicker game based off cookie clicker (made with Java). I wrote most of our model code and some of the GUI part so I think I am somewhat ok with it. I also learned the very basics of Unity and C# this summer and made a simple game with it. I also made a quiz website with HTML, CSS and JS as my CS project back in Grade 9.

## Justin Nicolas Camacho (Justin)

Hi everyone! I‚Äôm Justin (O-J-Be-Gl-G), a G11 student taking Physics 3 and Computer Science 5 for core and elective.

Besides my interest in CS, I have passions for basketball, writing (running for 16 months! I have multiple repositories that store my works :D, planning to join Ellipsis), singing (currently planning to audition for Himig Agham soon!), and law. You'll also notice from the pfp that I'm really into Taylor Swift's music and other mainstream pop artists' stuff üò≠

DMs are always open to talk about anything. :)

### Justin's experience with computer science in general

I started my coding adventure at 12 when Python was introduced to us very late in G7 CS1 after the pandemic hit; it was during this time that I discovered my love for coding, and my skills with it started blossoming in G8 when we were taught C++. I always enjoyed the problem sets and challenges Sir Paolo gave us at the time, and I ended the SY by working on a final passion project called 20-Options, a 2000+ line program that utilized C++ concepts I had to learn myself or already taught in the regular curriculum; I like to think that this project reflected my endurance/stamina in coding when I put my full focus to it. :)

In G9, I learned HTML/CSS/JS under Ma'am Aline. I had the most fun in this year developing visual materials and websites dedicated to my passions. While I was not introduced to all 3 languages before, I picked them up quickly and developed passion projects with them, including a pretty lengthy travel site about every country in the world (I never got to finish it üíÄ). While my skills with these languages have gotten rusty, I'll relearn them quickly for Reboot. :)

In G10, I picked up Java and even though it was the most dislikable language yet, I still worked with it with relative ease. I had more fun working on the visual end of the language (Java Swing main üíÄ), which was highlighted by my 1-day Minesweeper code, wherein I coded a working Minesweeper copy in <24 hours (It was an enlightening experience, knowing a group that aimed to build a Minesweeper copy for their final CS4 project and that I could've given that code to them üò≠). By the end of the SY though, my coding slowed down because of other responsibilities.

And here we are now, at G11 where I'm helping to organize an official CS team! While my interest in CS is on/off, I promise to put my full efforts, abilities, and priority toward building this new organization. :)

## Gian Ong (Gian)

Hello! My name is Gian, currently in 11-A. I am currently taking Phys3 as my core and Engg as my elective.

For my interests, I love playing video games, watch anime, and basketball.

### Gian's experience with competitive programming

Tbh, I don‚Äôt have any CompProg experience since I mostly program for fun in Scratch and Vexcode.  I enjoy coding for the most part especially if I solve a very complex problem that would lead to errors (Java moments). Also when I code, I sort of have a habit of making my code clean and short (when I have time) even though I finished it using long lines of code.

### Gian's experience with software development

I started coding in Grade 8 using C++, I enjoyed it a lot but haven‚Äôt done something big with it. In Grade 9, I learned HTML and Javascript and used it to make webpages. I became creative and had fun with it since it‚Äôs my first time creating some sort of a website. In Grade 10, I learned Java which is the hardest and the least fun programming language I learned. Yet, this is the time I got very interested in software development as I created a game for my project.

## Randolf Dela Cruz (Randolf)

Heya! I'm Randolf. I'm from Grade 11 - Block G, and my previous sections were Topaz/Ilang-Ilang/Magnesium/Tau, and I'm taking Physics core and CS elective this year. I love playing games! If you play Risk of Rain 2 hmu(!!!!), or even if you don't, my DMs are always open :)

Sometimes i like making games too. sometimes. actually more like rarely. It's hard to get motivation nowadays, since gamedev is such a massive commitment, but its something im really, really interested in huhu

### Randolf's experience with competitive programming

erm.. i dont have a lot of experience in compprog in all honesty.. i guess ive tried doing a bunch of code challenges online. i do have quite a bit of experience in the programming languages taught in PSHS' curriculum, like Python and Java, especially since I taught myself some of these languages even before I joined PSHS.

### Randolf's experience with software development

If game dev counts for software dev, then I've been making games with Scratch since long before I joined PSHS! Gamedev is just something I've always been in love with and I don't really know why. Eventually I moved to Unity to make some small projects. sadly i got tired of unity because i couldnt get out of tutorial hell (i basically got stuck),, so i eventually moved to making small game webpages in HTML. Years later i would finally arrive to where I am today with Godot, the main game engine that i use rn. There's only a couple game projects that I've actually completed, but there's way more stuff that I've started.... and never finished üòÖ

## Francois Toffer Zingapan (Francois)

Helo! I‚Äôm Francois (pronounced franswa) currently in 11G taking physics and computer science as my core and elective. I play a variety of video games including old titles like C&C Generals. I also draw sometimes and I read high fantasy novels like The Mistborn Series and The Rithmatist.

### Francois's experience with competitive programming

I started taking interest in Computer Science when I was second grade, picking up a book called Coding Unlocked. That taught me Python and, of course, Scratch. I did not start taking competitive programming until 10th grade, where I was given a lot of opportunities for competitions and workshops. I joined the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) and the National Olympiad on Informatics (NOI) and it was super fun solving the problems. Other than that, I do solve some occasional problems in Codeforces to hone my skills üòä

### Francois's experiences with software development

I do not have a lot of experience in software development, but I really gave a lot of effort with my HTML/CSS/JS project in ninth grade where I made a lot of effects that weren‚Äôt really taught in the curriculum.

## Joshua Peyton Chua (Joshua)

Hello everyone! I'm Joshua from block 11-B. I am currently taking chemistry as my core and biology as my elective. I like to play video games (mainly valorant --> peak diamond currently plat ü´•) and a variety of sports (basketball, swimming, badminton, ping pong, chess(?)). I also play the piano and occasionally make 2d and 3d design projects.

### Joshua's experience with competitive programming

Honestly, I don't really have much experience with competitive programming. I would say that my closest experience to this was trying some simple problems shown to me by my cousin, who loves joining coding competitions. I also able to learn about python and scratch from before I entered Pisay from a book my parents got me, in addition to the Pisay computer science curriculum that taught us other coding languages.

### Joshua's experience with software development

During elementary school, I used to make and play games on a coding website called Tynker, although it dealt more with block coding than the usual text coding used in more advanced languages. In Grade 9, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the curriculum, and honestly, those were the computer science topics I enjoyed the most among all grade levels. Lastly, in Grade 10, I was part of the ITI elective where one of our topics was using Unity to develop our own games.

## Alexander Cristobal (Alex)

Hi guys! My name‚Äôs Alex, currently in Grade 11 (E, Da, Rb, Gl, G) with Physics as my core and Engineering as my elective :DD. I‚Äôve always liked video games as far as I can remember, which is what made me rlly interested in CS as a whole. I mainly play FPS games like Valorant (peak ascendant, current diamond hmu if u wanna play uwu), and I really like story-driven games like The Last of Us, OneShot, and Undertale, just to name a few. I also rlly like playing table tennis (join pendulum, the ping pong club of pisay :D) and badminton, although I‚Äôm still pretty bad at ‚Äòem.

### Alex's experience with computer science in general

My first gateway to CS was making incredibly scuffed video games in Scratch during 4th-5th grade. Although I produced nothing spectacular, I at least got introduced to the concept of CS, like how variables and whatnot work in programming. Around 6th grade I started to learn making games in unity with C# for a short while, which built up my general knowledge of CS even more. From there I got exposed to Python (my personal favorite language), C++, HTML, and Java (ü§Æ)  from the CS courses here in Pisay. I‚Äôve also dabbled in 2D and 3D modelling from things like design competitions and my SIP last summer.
