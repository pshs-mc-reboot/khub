# Randolf Dela Cruz (Randolf)

Heya! I'm Randolf. I'm from Grade 11 - Block G, and my previous sections were Topaz/Ilang-Ilang/Magnesium/Tau, and I'm taking Physics core and CS elective this year. I love playing games! If you play Risk of Rain 2 hmu(!!!!), or even if you don't, my DMs are always open :)

Sometimes i like making games too. sometimes. actually more like rarely. It's hard to get motivation nowadays, since gamedev is such a massive commitment, but its something im really, really interested in huhu

## Randolf's experience with competitive programming

erm.. i dont have a lot of experience in compprog in all honesty.. i guess ive tried doing a bunch of code challenges online. i do have quite a bit of experience in the programming languages taught in PSHS' curriculum, like Python and Java, especially since I taught myself some of these languages even before I joined PSHS.

## Randolf's experience with software development

If game dev counts for software dev, then I've been making games with Scratch since long before I joined PSHS! Gamedev is just something I've always been in love with and I don't really know why. Eventually I moved to Unity to make some small projects. sadly i got tired of unity because i couldnt get out of tutorial hell (i basically got stuck),, so i eventually moved to making small game webpages in HTML. Years later i would finally arrive to where I am today with Godot, the main game engine that i use rn. There's only a couple game projects that I've actually completed, but there's way more stuff that I've started.... and never finished ðŸ˜…
