# Diogn Lei Mortera (Diogn)

Hallo everyone! My name is Diogn Lei Mortera (pronounced with a silent 'g'); you can call me "Diogn" or "Kuya Diogn", whichever you prefer. My previous sections were Garnet-Rosal-Rubidium-Gluon, and I'm currently a student belonging at Block G. My academic interests mainly revolve around Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science; on the other hand, my non-academic interests mostly involve PC and board gaming, chess, Rubik's cubing, movies, and music!

My DMs are open almost anytime, so feel free to talk to me about my academic/non-academic interests, or anything in particular :D

## Diogn's experience with competitive programming

To provide a background of my knowledge, I have experience in the programming languages taught in the PSHS curriculum (C++, JavaScript, Java, Python). My interests in gaming also helped me learn game-oriented programming languages (Lua, C#).
As mentioned above, I also have experience with various Codeforce (and some Leetcode) challenges, as well as national and international competitions such as NOI.ph and CCC.

## Diogn's experience with software development

Web-development-wise, I have intermediate knowledge of front-end tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Application-wise, I have knowledge of vanilla Java, as well as both JavaFX and Swing (although, I am more familiar with the former).
