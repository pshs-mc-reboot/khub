Hi guys! My nameâ€™s Alex, currently in Grade 11 (E, Da, Rb, Gl, G) with Physics as my core and Engineering as my elective :DD. Iâ€™ve always liked video games as far as I can remember, which is what made me rlly interested in CS as a whole. I mainly play FPS games like Valorant (peak ascendant, current diamond hmu if u wanna play uwu), and I really like story-driven games like The Last of Us, OneShot, and Undertale, just to name a few. I also rlly like playing table tennis (join pendulum, the ping pong club of pisay :D) and badminton, although Iâ€™m still pretty bad at â€˜em.

## Alex's experience with computer science in general

My first gateway to CS was making incredibly scuffed video games in Scratch during 4th-5th grade. Although I produced nothing spectacular, I at least got introduced to the concept of CS, like how variables and whatnot work in programming. Around 6th grade I started to learn making games in unity with C# for a short while, which built up my general knowledge of CS even more. From there I got exposed to Python (my personal favorite language), C++, HTML, and Java (ðŸ¤®)  from the CS courses here in Pisay. Iâ€™ve also dabbled in 2D and 3D modelling from things like design competitions and my SIP last summer.
