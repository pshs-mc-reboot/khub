# Krixian Skye Del Rosario (Skye)

Hello y'all!! I'm Skye, currently a grade 11 student (G-Ro-Li-Gl-G) taking Phy3 and CS5 :DD (my pronouns are he/him!)

As for my interests, I'm a very avid gamer, both when it comes to tabletop games and video games (recently, i've been playing a lot of genshin üëâüëà)! Also, I like to read webtoons and other webcomics!!

## Skye's experience with competitive programming

Not gonna lie, I actually haven't had much experience with CompProg until I joined RAM last SY (I discovered it very very indirectly through a friend, actually). I initially just joined the SoftDev division since I didn't think I'd be a very fast coder, but then a few of my friends went CompProg and I decided to try things there too, and they ended up being super fun! Competitions-wise, I've competed in both NOI.ph 2023 and CCC 2023 (ngl, nothing beats the euphoria of correctly solving the problems, even if they're "easy" ones), and I still plan to (hopefully) compete in future CompProg events as well!

Also, C++ mains wya !!!

## Skye's experience with software development

As for SoftDev, I've worked on a few websites before, both in elem and in Pisay. For my Grade 9 WebDev project, I decided to do a MrBeast-themed website (yes, I made a fanpage :'''' AHAHAH), which basically just talked about the history of MrBeast and his rise to YouTube fame! That site is probably so outdated by now so uhhh yea !!!

You might have already assumed by this point, but I have experience in using the usual WebDev trio languages (HTML-CSS-JS). I can usually hold my own in terms of doing WebDev with these three, but due to lack of practice, I've gotten a bit rusty :') (Google's always there for the save whenever I need it tho üôè)
