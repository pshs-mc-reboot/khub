# Francois Toffer Zingapan (Francois)

Helo! Iâ€™m Francois (pronounced franswa) currently in 11G taking physics and computer science as my core and elective. I play a variety of video games including old titles like C&C Generals. I also draw sometimes and I read high fantasy novels like The Mistborn Series and The Rithmatist.

## Francois's experience with competitive programming

I started taking interest in Computer Science when I was second grade, picking up a book called Coding Unlocked. That taught me Python and, of course, Scratch. I did not start taking competitive programming until 10th grade, where I was given a lot of opportunities for competitions and workshops. I joined the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) and the National Olympiad on Informatics (NOI) and it was super fun solving the problems. Other than that, I do solve some occasional problems in Codeforces to hone my skills ðŸ˜Š

## Francois's experiences with software development

I do not have a lot of experience in software development, but I really gave a lot of effort with my HTML/CSS/JS project in ninth grade where I made a lot of effects that werenâ€™t really taught in the curriculum.
