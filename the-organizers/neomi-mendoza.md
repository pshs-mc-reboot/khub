# Neomi Mendoza (Neomi)

Hi everyone, I'm Neomi! You may refer to me with feminine honorifics (I am personally very fond of Ate Neo), or simply by my name (or nickname). If you want to contact me, my Discord DMs are always open (lunar_bloom)!

## Neomi's experience with competitive programming

The story that I would like to begin this with is that, really, I got into competitive programming in the hopes of having common interests with your Kuya Dylan Dalida (which I think is the most not-so-secret secret I have). I grinded Abakoda 2021, got into the top rookies. I joined NOI 2022, got into the IOI training pool, but had to become inactive because of (unrelated) mental health reasons.
Personally, I think that I'm capable of solving 3000-level Codeforces problems within a week or so, and am not particularly good in a short contest settings. I have the ability of explaining the high level ideas fairly confidently to others, but I still hold your Kuya Dylan in very high regard (he's just that cool).

## Neomi's experience with software development

Okay, this is a field that I'm fairly confident aboutâ€”the occasional imposter syndrome aside. I first got my interests in software creation during G10 (Java Swing moment ðŸ’€), but it didn't really lead me anywhere. Last 2022 though, I volunteered to be taught and implement the Programming Platform for NOI.PHâ€”I think saying that my roots lie there is an understatement. Eventually my experiences there, as well as the applications I've made for Math Modelling, put enough oomph in my resume that I got into various software development/engineering positions.
