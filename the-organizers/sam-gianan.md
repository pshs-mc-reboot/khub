# Sam Gianan (Sam)

Hi! I'm Sam (she/her) of B2025! I'm into writing, 3D modelling, drawing, coding, and researching!

## Sam's experience with competitive programming

I've done very little competitive programming; usually I've just read through problems on Codeforces with friends T-T However, I decided recently to put time into learning more CompProg and try out more problems. I've also had a good time doing the sample logic problems back when I still had CS as a subject. Soonetheless, despite this lack of experience, I've been coding since 2020 and I think I can say I have good design thinking and problem solving skills (albeit applied in other aspects i.e. Math, Engineering, and Research)!

## Sam's experience with software development

I'm much more confident here! I started out coding with C++ in Grade 8 (though tried out Python and Scratch even years ago), and made my final project as a text-based burger restaurant simulator!

In Grade 9, I revisited Python and Scratch even more and learned HTML, CSS, and JS as well. Our final project this time was a puzzle-based website game. If it's not obvious now, I'm into web development and game development a lot!

I spent the time after making projects such as an introductory website for our friend group, an 8-bit-themed game about Hercules, and even ideating a web app!

In Grade 10, I learned Java, with our final project being an investigative horror-comedy game with battles, puzzles, and storylines! Not only did I do some coding for this, but I also made all of the art assets! It was also around this time that I played with the Chrome Music Maker to make 8-bit-themed music.

I also started learning Flutter and Renpy. I've also been working on learning Unity for more game development projects, especially since I want to apply my aforementioned asset skills along with knowledge in writing and 3D modelling! Currently, my friend and I are ideating some app/website projects. :)))
