## Maya Bartolabac (Maya)

Hi guys! I'm Maya, and I go by she/her and other feminine stuff. I really am sorry if I look and sound like a boy in real life. I am a 2025 from Lantican, taking Physics Core and CS Elective.

### Maya's General Programming Experience

I started coding when I was 12 with Python. Since then, my interest for general CS stuff has not died down a bit, and with passionate self-learning I slowly learned more and more technologies and overall aspects of computing, varying from computer engineering with Minecraft redstone, to algorithmic music making with Supercollider, to the bottomless rabbithole that is pure Functional Programming and Type Theory. This 5 year journey of self-learning has taken me to various esoteric places, and I became a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None" kind of person.

### Maya's experience with Computer Programming and Software Development

For CompProg, my only experience was with joining RAM in 2022 when I enjoyed going through the CodeForces starter problems. For SoftDev, my only experience with that was carrying my classmates in CS projects. That and a failed attempt to make a game.

Honestly, I've always really lacked the confidence and motivation of doing something big. If you want some good looking achievements, you have to start at some time, and I'm starting now. I guess I am a late bloomer compared to the rest of the organizers here. But I will make up for that by blooming big.
