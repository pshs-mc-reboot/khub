# Justin Nicolas Camacho (Justin)

Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Justin (O-J-Be-Gl-G), a G11 student taking Physics 3 and Computer Science 5 for core and elective.

Besides my interest in CS, I have passions for basketball, writing (running for 16 months! I have multiple repositories that store my works :D, planning to join Ellipsis), singing (currently planning to audition for Himig Agham soon!), and law. You'll also notice from the pfp that I'm really into Taylor Swift's music and other mainstream pop artists' stuff ðŸ˜­

DMs are always open to talk about anything. :)

## Justin's experience with computer science in general

I started my coding adventure at 12 when Python was introduced to us very late in G7 CS1 after the pandemic hit; it was during this time that I discovered my love for coding, and my skills with it started blossoming in G8 when we were taught C++. I always enjoyed the problem sets and challenges Sir Paolo gave us at the time, and I ended the SY by working on a final passion project called 20-Options, a 2000+ line program that utilized C++ concepts I had to learn myself or already taught in the regular curriculum; I like to think that this project reflected my endurance/stamina in coding when I put my full focus to it. :)

In G9, I learned HTML/CSS/JS under Ma'am Aline. I had the most fun in this year developing visual materials and websites dedicated to my passions. While I was not introduced to all 3 languages before, I picked them up quickly and developed passion projects with them, including a pretty lengthy travel site about every country in the world (I never got to finish it ðŸ’€). While my skills with these languages have gotten rusty, I'll relearn them quickly for Reboot. :)

In G10, I picked up Java and even though it was the most dislikable language yet, I still worked with it with relative ease. I had more fun working on the visual end of the language (Java Swing main ðŸ’€), which was highlighted by my 1-day Minesweeper code, wherein I coded a working Minesweeper copy in <24 hours (It was an enlightening experience, knowing a group that aimed to build a Minesweeper copy for their final CS4 project and that I could've given that code to them ðŸ˜­). By the end of the SY though, my coding slowed down because of other responsibilities.

And here we are now, at G11 where I'm helping to organize an official CS team! While my interest in CS is on/off, I promise to put my full efforts, abilities, and priority toward building this new organization. :)
