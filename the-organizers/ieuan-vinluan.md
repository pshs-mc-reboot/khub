# Ieuan Vinluan (Ieuan)

Hello!! I'm Ieuan, and I'm in G11 !! I'm fine with any pronouns :D

## Ieuan's experience with competitive programming

I joined a coding camp a few months ago and got really into compprog because of it!! This summer, I started solving more problems online, studying more of the concepts involved in many compprog problems, and recently started joining online compprog contests. I think I have a decent grasp of the basics of these concepts, but I'm not that great in contest settings ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­

## Ieuan's experience with software development

My very very first experience with software development was making games in Scratch at a programming camp a few years ago. A few years later, I got into software development more (because of school). I started out making random games with HTML / CSS / JS in G9, and in G10, I made a knock off version of KHub with JavaFX for CS4, which was kinda fun. I also tried making machine learning models, although they're not that complex in nature LOL
