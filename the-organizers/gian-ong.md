# Gian Ong (Gian)

Hello! My name is Gian, currently in 11-A. I am currently taking Phys3 as my core and Engg as my elective.

For my interests, I love playing video games, watch anime, and basketball.

## Gian's experience with competitive programming

Tbh, I don’t have any CompProg experience since I mostly program for fun in Scratch and Vexcode.  I enjoy coding for the most part especially if I solve a very complex problem that would lead to errors (Java moments). Also when I code, I sort of have a habit of making my code clean and short (when I have time) even though I finished it using long lines of code.

## Gian's experience with software development

I started coding in Grade 8 using C++, I enjoyed it a lot but haven’t done something big with it. In Grade 9, I learned HTML and Javascript and used it to make webpages. I became creative and had fun with it since it’s my first time creating some sort of a website. In Grade 10, I learned Java which is the hardest and the least fun programming language I learned. Yet, this is the time I got very interested in software development as I created a game for my project.
