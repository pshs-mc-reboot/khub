# Gabee De Vera (Gabee)

Hi! I'm Gabee De Vera!

Sections are Ruby-Sampaguita-Potassium-Muon-11G. I have quite a lot of interests, including reading (webtoons, manga, normal books), drawing digital art, playing instruments, and Pokemon ^^

I also love learning about math and CS, to the point that I watch math and CS videos in my free time. My favorite math/CS topic in particular are sequences and recurrences (as well as the related matrix decomposition technique). My favorite algorithm is currently the FFT ^^

## Gabee's experience with competitive programming

I'd say my time with Competitive Programming started as early as grade 8. Before, I doubted my skills in implementing algorithms and data structures. However, in grade 8, I passed an "original" algorithm to my CS teacher for a homework on sorting arrays. Little did I know that that "original" algorithm is actually an algorithm known as "counting sort". This little incident gave me enough confidence the next year to join the NOI, where I got until the finals (I placed 18th). I then grinded on Codeforces until I reached Specialist. I did very well in Abakoda, and reached the in-house round in NOI the next year (I placed 5th).

This summer, upon Kuya Dylan's request, I learned how to write competitive programming problems ^^

## Gabee's experience with software development

I got into software development at around 3rd grade, where I started making games on Hopscotch (similar to Scratch). I started learning web dev at around 4th-6th grade ^^
At around 9th grade, I started to get really comfortable with programming in general to the point that I can pick up new languages within a matter of days ^^

I made a chess game with JavaFX when I was in grade 10, some multiplayer games with Node.JS in grades 8-9, a Unity game based on Anya Forger's obsession with peanuts in grade 9, and some ML models from grades 8-9 ^^
