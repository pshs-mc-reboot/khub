# Clark Tongco (Clark)

Hello there! My name is Clark Tongco, and I'm from Block B. You can call me Clark (or Kuya Clark for lower batches). My interests are centered on chemistry, biology, and computer science (sometimes physics). In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and kdramas. I also enjoy solving Rubik's cubes and playing chess.

## Clark's experience with computer science in general

I began coding when I was in eighth grade. C++ was my first programming language, and it is still my favorite. I like how simple it is to understand, and I see its potential in building various projects and solving problems. Some of the games I've made with C++ include Battleship, Tic Tac Toe, and many others. Unfortunately, I don't have a duplicate of them because that was quite some time ago. HTML and JavaScript were presented to us in Grade 9. I also enjoy JavaScript because it is one of those programming languages that is simple to learn and understand. I used these to make various webpages and had a great time doing so. Finally, in Grade 10, we learned about Java. This programming language is one of my least favorites since it gave me a hard time especially in creating projects.
