# Introduction to Programming

This article aims to be a language-agnostic introduction to programming. We aim to teach you:

1. Knowledge of concepts
2. Programming skills
3. Problem solving

## The computer and you

If you were to remember only **one** thing from this module, take this to heart:

> The computer will **only** do, and **always** does, what you tell it to do.

There's nothing magical behind it; it only knows how to do stuff extremely quickly.

As much as a computer is able to:

- perform billions of calculations per second
- store hundreds of gigabytes into memory

It will only know and do what you tell them.

If your program breaks, it's a *you* problem. ðŸ«µðŸ˜Ž

### Types of calculations

So, what types of calculations are we talking about?

- **Built-in** calculations, meaning the low-level operations that allow for higher-level ones
  - Memory-based operations
  - Mathematical operations
- **Programmer-defined** calculations, which use the built in features into more complex computer instructions

### Types of knowledge

Given these types of calculations, what types of knowledge do we have that would be relevant to a machine?

- **Declarative** knowledge are statements of fact.
  - The first five people who signed up to the information session got one hundred pesos as a reward.
  - This module does its best to be straight to the point.
- **Imperative** knowledge is a sequence of steps. This can be viewed as a flow of declarative knowledge.
  1. The sign up form is opened.
  2. Someone signs up in the form.
  3. A seat in the information session is reserved for them.

The computer is a purely imperative machine, but higher levels of abstraction (i.e., programming languages, GUIs) make way for declarative statements.

### Types of computers

Given that a computer is a machine that executes imperative knowledge, let's look specifically into the kinds that capture imperative knowledge in a certain way:

- **fixed-program** computers have a fixed set of capabilities designed by the manufaturers of the device. The instructions of these machines can't be modified.
  - calculators
  - sensors
- **stored-program** computers allow for the expansion of its capabilities via the addition of programs into it.
  - phones
  - laptops

## Basic computer architecture

On the whole, a stored program computer has four main parts:

- The **memory** is where data are stored in certain ways.
- The **input** is all of the data that the user gives to the computer for processing.
- The **output** is all of the data that is given by the computer to the user in response to certain input.
- The **central processing unit** (CPU) processes input and returns output through two main parts:
  - The **arithmetic logic unit** (ALU) does mathematical built-in calculation operations.
  - The **control unit** contains one program counter (something that uses memory-based built-in calculation operations).
