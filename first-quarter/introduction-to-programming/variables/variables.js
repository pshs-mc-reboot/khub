// This file is an example of how to use variables in JavaScript.

// Variables in JavaScript may be declared using one of the following keywords:
// 1. var
// 2. let
// 3. const

// The var keyword is the oldest of the three and allows you to reassign the value of a variable after it has been declared.
var x = 10

// It also allows you to redeclare a variable after it has been declared.
var x = 15

// The let keyword is the newest of the three and allows you to reassign the value of a variable after it has been declared.
// It does not allow you to redeclare a variable after it has been declared.
let y = 20

// The const keyword is the newest of the three and does not allow you to reassign the value of a variable after it has been declared.
// It also does not allow you to redeclare a variable after it has been declared.
const z = 25

console.log(x) // 15
console.log(y) // 20
console.log(z) // 25
