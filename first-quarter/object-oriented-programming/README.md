# Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a paradigm that organizes data and behavior into reusable units called objects. Objects have two main features: attributes and methods.

- Attributes are variables that store the state of an object, such as its name, color, size, etc.
- Methods are functions that define the behavior of an object, such as what it can do, how it can interact with other objects, etc.

OOP allows programmers to create complex systems by combining simpler objects that share common characteristics or functionalities.

One of the main benefits of OOP is that it promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. By encapsulating data and behavior into objects, programmers can hide the implementation details and expose only the relevant interfaces to other parts of the system. This makes the code easier to understand, modify, and reuse. OOP also facilitates code reuse by allowing programmers to create classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. Classes can be reused to create multiple instances of objects with the same structure and behavior.
