# Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a paradigm that organizes data and behavior into reusable units called objects. Objects have two main features: attributes and methods.

- Attributes are variables that store the state of an object, such as its name, color, size, etc.
- Methods are functions that define the behavior of an object, such as what it can do, how it can interact with other objects, etc.

OOP allows programmers to create complex systems by combining simpler objects that share common characteristics or functionalities.

One of the main benefits of OOP is that it promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. By encapsulating data and behavior into objects, programmers can hide the implementation details and expose only the relevant interfaces to other parts of the system. This makes the code easier to understand, modify, and reuse. OOP also facilitates code reuse by allowing programmers to create classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. Classes can be reused to create multiple instances of objects with the same structure and behavior.

## Abstraction and Encapsulation

Abstraction and Encapsulation are two complementary concepts in OOP that enable modularity and maintainability of code.

**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the unnecessary details of an object and exposing only the essential features that are relevant to the context. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the *what rather than the how* of an object, and to simplify complex systems by reducing the amount of information they have to deal with.

**Encapsulation** is the technique of bundling the data and behavior of an object into a single unit, and restricting access to its internal state. Encapsulation ensures that the object's data is *consistent and valid*, and that its behavior is *controlled and predictable*. Encapsulation also protects the object from being modified or manipulated by external agents, and prevents unwanted side effects or dependencies.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

Another benefit of OOP is that it supports inheritance and polymorphism, which are concepts that enable code reuse and flexibility.

**Inheritance** is the mechanism by which a class can inherit the attributes and methods of another class, called the parent class or **superclass**. The class that inherits from the parent class is called the child class or **subclass**. The child class can access and modify the attributes and methods of the parent class, as well as add its own attributes and methods. This way, the child class can extend or override the functionality of the parent class.

**Polymorphism** is the ability of an object to behave differently depending on the context or the type of the object. For example, a method can have different implementations in different classes, but still have the same name and parameters. This allows programmers to use the same method name for different types of objects, and the appropriate implementation will be executed at runtime. Polymorphism can be achieved by using inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, or method overloading.
